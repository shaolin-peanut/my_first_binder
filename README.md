Testing the binder platform to edit Jupyter notebooks that are stored on github repos

I will use Jupypter notebooks on binder to go through the 'Master Math by coding in Python' course (at least the beginning).
Having trouble installing anaconda on my Arch Linux, so that's a portable/frictionless alternative for now.

I'm doing this repo to follow through with [this tutorial](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/binder/zero-to-binder.html)

Open the notebooks by clicking here [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/shaolin-peanut/my_first_binder/HEAD)
